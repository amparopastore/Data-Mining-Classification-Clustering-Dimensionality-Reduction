# Data Mining: Classification and Clustering Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of classification and clustering methods, with a focus on dimensionality reduction techniques and performance evaluation. The work is organized into detailed sections, each exploring different aspects of data mining and machine learning.

## Table of Contents

1. **Preparing the Data**
   - Steps to clean, preprocess, and prepare the data for analysis.

2. **Covariance Matrix Analysis**
   - Examination of the covariance matrix to understand relationships between features.

3. **Classification Experiment**
   - Evaluation of various classification algorithms:
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
     - Naïve Bayes
     - Naïve Bayes from scratch

4. **Clustering Experiment**
   - Exploration of clustering methods with different numbers of clusters:
     - Clustering with `n_clusters=5` (3 methods)
     - Results, evaluation metrics, and visualization
     - Clustering with `n_clusters=2` (3 methods)

5. **Five-Stage Classification Test**
   - Testing and evaluation of classification performance across multiple stages.

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summary of findings and insights from the experiments.
